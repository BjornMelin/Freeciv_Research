In the chat shell, various console commands may be used.

Key commands: /show, /help, /set.
/show gives a display of all changable options
/help gives a list of useful tools
/set changes ingame options

"/set minplayers __" to adjust the number of players
"/set timeout __" to adjust the time of each turn in seconds
"/set endt __" to adjust the maximum number of turns

To turn off map features, game/options/local client and uncheck every box that involves displaying something.

In pregame lobby, right click on player and select "aitoggleplayer" to change player to AI

To run "headless", set minplayers to 0, change to an AI, set timeout to 1 second, turn off map features. Optionally put max turns.

Also possible to run just the server without client. Can use console commands to control, however it is difficult to find final scores without client.

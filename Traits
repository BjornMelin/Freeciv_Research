The behavior of AI players in Freeciv are governed by three traits: Expansionist, the desire to settle new territory; Trader, the desire to establish trade
routes; and Aggression, the desire to declare war. By default, these traits are all set to 50 for each nation, however this may be adjusted in custom rulesets.
To change these values, find the relevant civ in Freeciv-2.5.11\data\civ2\nation, and include a line such as 'trait_expansionist = 75' to increase their 
expansionist behavior.
Alternatively, can be modified via Lua scripting using the command edit.trait_mod(player,trait,amount).
